1. Introduction
Traveling is not just about reaching a destination; it’s about discovering experiences. In today’s digital era, planning a journey often involves multiple disconnected platforms—for browsing tour packages, booking vehicles, comparing resorts, and checking safety. This fragmentation can overwhelm users and impact the travel experience. The Travel & Tourism Website aims to centralize these services into a single, seamless, and interactive web platform. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this platform simplifies travel planning while adding layers of safety (Scam Alert), convenience (Car Rent & Resort Hunt), and engagement (Tour Details & Packages).
2. Objectives
- To create a centralized and responsive web application for travel enthusiasts. - To integrate features like login/signup, travel package booking, car rentals, resort discovery, and scam alerts. - To enable users to explore, plan, and secure their travel itineraries in one place. - To ensure security and trust through verified information and community feedback. - To build a modern, user-friendly interface for maximum accessibility and ease of use.
3. Scope of the Project
The proposed website will be accessible from browsers on all modern platforms. The application will cover the entire journey lifecycle — from browsing packages and booking
tours, to safety checks and renting transport — with a sleek user interface powered by React.
